# Embedded-FSM-Interrupt-Design
This repository demonstrates core embedded systems concepts implemented in Embedded C, focusing on state-machine-based design, interrupt-driven execution, and hardware–software interaction.  The examples are independently written and inspired by hands-on learning during an Embedded Systems internship program.
